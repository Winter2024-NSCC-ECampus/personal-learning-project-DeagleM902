# DeagleMGitHubSelfLearning
This is my Milestone 1. I have 2 GoDot projects showcasing some of the nodes and scripts I've been learning.

## NodesTesting - 2D platformer
This is the main project showcasing the use of several different nodes including Lighting, Tilemaps, and Player character related nodes.

## TopDownTest - Vampire Survivors inspired
This project snippet includes top-down 2D movement and an enemy spawning method.
