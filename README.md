# DeagleMGitHubSelfLearning
This is my Milestone 2. I have 2 GoDot projects showcasing some of the nodes and scripts I've been working on and learning about.

### NOTE - This project is using GoDot v4.3

## NodesTesting - 2D platformer
This is the main project showcasing the use of several different nodes including Lighting, Tilemaps, and Player character related nodes. A small level that can be navigated with a player character. The player can interact with coins, a moving platform, spike hazards, and an enemy slime.

## TopDownTest - Vampire Survivors inspired
This project snippet includes top-down 2D movement, a timer, and an enemy spawning method. The level achieves an infinite scrolling effect through the use of a Parallax2D background node. The spawning of enemies is achieved through a "game manager" script which controls the timer display as well as the instantiation (add_child) of enemies with given parameters. The player has a projectile "wand" weapon and several passive items, these can all be upgraded through levels or a chest system.
